Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadnâ€™t been looking for you, I couldâ€™ve stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell. You thereâ€”you and meâ€”we shouldnâ€™t be here. Itâ€™s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Weâ€™re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Shut up back there!

Whatâ€™s wrong with him, huh?

Watch your tongue! Youâ€™re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King!

Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? Youâ€™re the leader of the rebellion. But if theyâ€™ve captured youâ€¦ Oh gods, where are they taking us?

I donâ€™t know where weâ€™re going, but Sovngarde awaits.

No, this canâ€™t be happening. This isnâ€™t happening.

Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?

Why do you care?

A Nordâ€™s last thoughts should be of home.

Rorikstead. Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m from Rorikstead.

General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

Good. Letâ€™s get this over with.

Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

Look at him. General Tullius, the military governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.

This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funnyâ€¦ when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

Who are they, Daddy? Where are they going?

You need to go inside, little cub.

Why? I want to watch the soldiers.

Inside the house. Now.

Yes, Papa.

Why are we stopping?

Why do you think? End of the line. Letâ€™s go. Shouldnâ€™t keep the gods waiting for us.

No, wait! Weâ€™re not rebels!

Face your death with some courage, thief.

Youâ€™ve got to tell them! We werenâ€™t with you! This is a mistake!

Anyone else feel like running?

Wait. You there. Step forward.

Who are you?

You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman. Captain, what should we do? Heâ€™s not on the list.

Forget the list. He goes to the block.

By your orders, Captain. Iâ€™m sorry. Weâ€™ll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock. Follow the Captain, prisoner.

Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero, but a hero doesnâ€™t use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne. You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down and restore the peace.

What was that?

Itâ€™s nothing. Carry on.

Yes, General Tullius. Give them their last rites.

As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon youâ€”

For the love of Talos, shut up and letâ€™s get this over with.

As you wish.

Come on! I havenâ€™t got all morning.

Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!

There it is again. Did you hear that?

I said, next prisoner!

To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.

What in Oblivion is that?!

Sentries, what do you see?!

Itâ€™s in the clouds!

Dragon!

Hey, kinsman! Get up! Come on, the gods wonâ€™t give us another chance! This way!`);
